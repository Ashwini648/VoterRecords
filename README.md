Voter ID Management System

This project manages the details of individuals in the context of voter registration. It allows CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for storing and updating person details, including linking each person with their voter ID and constituency information. The application uses Hibernate for database interaction and MySQL as the backend database.

Features:
Add Person: Store new person details along with their Aadhar ID and associated voter information.
Get Person: Retrieve person details by Aadhar ID.
Update Person: Modify existing person details such as name and voter constituency.
Delete Person: Remove a person from the system using their Aadhar ID.
This system is built using Java, Hibernate ORM, and MySQL.
